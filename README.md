# ResoniteKeybinds
A simple mod that allows you to change your keybinds for desktop.

Needs [ResoniteModSettings](https://github.com/badhaloninja/ResoniteModSettings) for the settings screen.

The order the controls are in the same order the code is in, if you want the order changed for a good reason please make an issue :). It might be that the default controls seem like they have been chaged but some controls had doube bindings and I had to make a choice for which one the default should be, again if you want this changed lmk!
